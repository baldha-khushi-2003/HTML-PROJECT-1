  <u> <P>From September through October 2010, the company began rolling out "New Twitter", an entirely revamped edition of twitter.com. Changes included the ability to see pictures and videos without leaving Twitter itself by clicking on individual tweets which contain links to images and clips from a variety of supported websites, including YouTube and Flickr, and a complete overhaul of the interface, which shifted links such as '@mentions' and 'Retweets' above the Twitter stream, while 'Messages' and 'Log Out' became accessible via a black bar at the very top of twitter.com. As of November 1, 2010, the company confirmed that the "New Twitter experience" had been rolled out to all users. In 2019, Twitter was announced to be the 10th most downloaded mobile app of the decade, from 2010 to 2019.[54]

On April 5, 2011, Twitter tested a new homepage and phased out the "Old Twitter".[55] However, a glitch came about after the page was launched, so the previous "retro" homepage was still in use until the issues were resolved; the new homepage was reintroduced on April 20.[56][57] On December 8, 2011, Twitter overhauled its website once more to feature the "Fly" design, which the service says is easier for new users to follow and promotes advertising. In addition to the Home tab, the Connect and Discover tabs were introduced along with a redesigned profile and timeline of Tweets. The site's layout has been compared to that of Facebook.[58][59] On February 21, 2012, it was announced that Twitter and Yandex agreed to a partnership. Yandex, a Russian search engine, finds value within the partnership due to Twitter's real time news feeds. Twitter's director of business development explained that it is important to have Twitter content where Twitter users go.[60] On March 21, 2012, Twitter celebrated its sixth birthday while also announcing that it had 140 million users and 340 million tweets per day. The number of users was up 40% from their September 2011 number, which was said to have been at 100 million at the time.[61]

On June 5, 2012, a modified logo was unveiled through the company blog, removing the text to showcase the slightly redesigned bird as the sole symbol of Twitter.[62][63] On December 18, 2012, Twitter announced it had surpassed 200 million monthly active users. Twitter hit 100 million monthly active users in September 2011.[64]

On January 28, 2013, Twitter acquired Crashlytics in order to build out its mobile developer products.[65] On April 18, 2013, Twitter launched a music app called Twitter Music for the iPhone.[66] On August 28, 2013, Twitter acquired Trendrr,[67] followed by the acquisition of MoPub on September 9, 2013.[68] As of September 2013, the company's data showed that 200 million users sent over 400 million tweets daily, with nearly 60% of tweets sent from mobile devices.[69]

During Super Bowl XLVII on February 3, 2013, the power went out in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome Mondelez International vice president Lisa Mann was asked to tweet, "You can still dunk in the dark", referring to Oreo cookies. She approved, and as she told Ad Age in 2020, "literally the world changed when I woke up the next morning." This became a milestone in the development of commenting daily on culture.[70]</P>

<p>Twitter experienced considerable growth during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.[82] The platform also was increasingly used for misinformation related to the pandemic.[83] Twitter started marking tweets which contained misleading information, and adding links to fact-checks.[84] In May 2020, Twitter moderators marked two tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump as "potentially misleading" and linked to a fact-check.[85] Trump responded by signing an executive order to weaken Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which limits social media sites' liability for content moderation decisions.[86][87][88] Twitter later banned Trump, claiming that he violated "the glorification of violence policy".[89] The ban was criticized by conservatives and some European leaders, who saw it as an interference on freedom of speech.[90]

On June 5, 2021, the Nigerian government issued an indefinite ban on Twitter usage in the country, citing "misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences",[91] after the platform removed tweets made by the Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari.[92] Nigeria's ban was criticized by Amnesty International.[93]

In 2021, Twitter began the research phase of Bluesky, an open source decentralized social media protocol where users can choose which algorithmic curation they want.[94][95] The same year, Twitter also released Twitter Spaces, a social audio feature;[96][97] "super follows", a way to subscribe to creators for exclusive content;[98] and a beta of "ticketed Spaces", which makes access to certain audio rooms paid.[99] Twitter unveiled a redesign in August, 2021, with adjusted colors and a new Chirp font, which improves the left-alignment of most Western languages.[100]

In June 2022, Twitter announced a partnership with e-commerce giant Shopify, and its plans to launch a sales channel app for U.S. Shopify merchants.[101]sss</p>
